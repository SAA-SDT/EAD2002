# EAD2002
Encoded Archival Description Version 2002

EAD 2002 is deprecated and no longer supported by the Technical Subcommittee on Encoded Archival Standards. As of 2019, this version of the standard is still used in the archival community. The EAD2002 schemas will remain available at this location and all versions are also still hosted by the Library of Congress (e.g. https://www.loc.gov/ead/ead.xsd).
