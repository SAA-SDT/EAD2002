# EAD2002
Encoded Archival Description Version 2002

EAD 2002 is deprecated and no longer supported by the Technical Subcommittee on Encoded Archival Standards. 

The latest status is from fall 2021, when the value lists included in EAD 2002 e.g. for country, language, and script codes have been removed and the data type of the relevant attributes has been changed to NMTOKEN. This does now allow for more recently published codes from the respective ISO standards 3166-1, 639-2b, and 15924 to be used with EAD 2002 files, but also enables other values to be included where appropriate. This change follows TS-EAS' design principles 7 and 10 (see: [Design Principles](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/TS-EAS-subteam-notes/wiki/Design-Principles)). 

As of 2021, this version of the standard is still used in the archival community. The EAD 2002 schemas will remain available at this location and all versions are also still hosted by the Library of Congress (e.g. https://www.loc.gov/ead/ead.xsd).
